# php-test-runner.nvim
ðŸ§ª Run PHP test suites from within Neovim.

This plugin is very much a work in progress. Currently only runs 
`./vendor/bin/phpunit` in the current working directory and spits the results 
into a new floating window. I plan to add more options for testing frameworks
once the core functionality is working as I like it.
